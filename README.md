## Challenges we ran into 💪
- We faced a lot of challenges throughout the project. Some issues we ran into were trying to figure out how to properly use the OpenAI API for our backend to communicate with. Another issue was setting up the backend server so that it would communicate with the database and client properly and pass in the correct information. Lastly, another challenge we faced was the timezone differences between some of our members and limited communications since the difference was great.
Accomplishments that we're proud of 🚀
- We were proud of being able to implement the Open AI implementation so that the user's questionnaire results would be saved for the user's account in the database and then presented as the entire workout plan that the AI develops.
